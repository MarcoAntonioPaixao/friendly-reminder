# friendly-reminder

Friendly reminder is a extension that intends to implement a very specific functionality, the ability of configuring a message to be shown whenever the user opens a specific file.

The goal is by no means to replace documentation, but to give teams the ability to remind team-members about very specific situations regarding certaing parts of their codebase.

## Planned Features

What follows are the planned initial features of this extension:

- The ability to configure, through a file in the repo's root, a set of messages to be shown whenever a file is opened on vscode.

- The file is specified through it's path, allowing a range of files to be linked to a message.

- Any individual message will be shown only once, if vscode is closed, the counter resets.

## Support platforms

Support for both linux and windows file systems is planned.
